import pandas as pd                                              # importing pandas library
df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/17pol/Downloads/Q9_a.csv')            # to read the uploaded csv file
print(df.skew())                                                 # to find skewness of data
df.kurt()                                                        # to find kurtosis of data

Output             Speed      Distance
Skewness       -0.117510      0.806895
Kurtosis       -0.508994      0.405053

Inferences:
1. Speed skewness is within range -0.5 to 0.5 thus, data is fairly symmetrical
2. Distance data has a positive skewness less than 1 thus, it is moderately right skewed data
3. Speed kurtosis is less than zero and thus is a platykurtic data with light tails
4. Distance kurtosis is greater than zero and thus a leptokurtic data with heavy tails.
5. But, both the kurtosis values are nearing zero, thus it can be inferred that the data is nearly normal and mesokurtic.
